## Description <a name="description"></a>
This project was designed to reinforce the concepts of API creation using a NoSQL database like MongoDB. I created an API that performs CRUD operations within a MVC system. Testing of these routes were completed within Insomnia, as the application is not deployed. This project was completed with the assistance of a classmate.
## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
To install, clone this repo and run npm install. Then, you should be able to run node server.js and use Insomnia to test the routes. A walkthrough of these routes is provided [here](https://watch.screencastify.com/v/TQIXiqXqEpXn2RxghUrR). Note: there is no seed file, so you must use the POST routes to create your own info within the database.
